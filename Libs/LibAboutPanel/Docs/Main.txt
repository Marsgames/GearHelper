==What it does==
Lib About Panel is a small library which will add an about panel to your Blizzard interface options. You can specify whether or not to have the panel linked to a main panel, or just have it created separately. It will populate the fields of the about panel from the fields located in your ToC.

==Donations==
I have setup a donation site via [http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/3462 Pledgie].  Feel free to donate if you like this mod.  I have put countless hours of time and effort into it along with many people who have helped me.  I did not write this mod with the intent to make any money from it, I wrote it to help me with some needs that I saw in-game.

==How to get it to work==
To create the about panel, just add the following line of code into your mod:

 LibStub("LibAboutPanel").new(parentframe, addonname)

It will also return the frame so you can call it like:

 frame = LibStub("LibAboutPanel").new(parentframe, addonname)

The parentframe option may be nil, in which case it will not anchor the about panel to any frame. Otherwise, it will anchor the about frame to that frame.

The second option is the name of your add-on. This is mandatory as the about panel will pull all information from this add-ons ToC.

The ToC fields which the add-on reads are:

<code>
"Notes"
"Version"
"Author"
"X-Author-Faction"
"X-Author-Server"
"X-Category"
"X-License"
"X-Email"
"X-Website"
"X-Credits"
"X-Localizations"
"X-Donate"
</code>

It will only read fields when they exist, and skip them if they do not exist. 

== Example Code ==
'''ToC File:'''
<code>
 ## Title: Alt-Tabber
 
 ## Notes: Plays a noise when you're alt-tabbed for a ready check (even when sound is turned off)
 
 ## Author: Ackis
